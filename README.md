**Project Overview:**

This dataset simulates a real-world scenario for public health and environmental monitoring. It integrates data on:
•	Air quality indicators
•	Weather conditions
•	Mobility patterns
•	Healthcare utilization (specifically, respiratory-related hospital and emergency visits)
The data covers five regions over two years (2020–2022) and examines how environmental factors and mobility impact respiratory health.

**Project Objectives & Scope:**

We will explore:
Temporal trends: How weather parameters change over time (daily, monthly, seasonally).
Geographical comparisons: Differences in weather and air quality across continents or climate zones.
Correlations: Relationships between variables like temperature vs. humidity, or air quality vs. precipitation.
Extreme conditions: Identifying regions with extreme temperatures, poor air quality, or unusual weather events.
Environmental insights: How air quality metrics relate to weather conditions and what that implies for public health or climate change.

**Project Plan:**
